    <h1>Early works</h1>
    <h2>(1889-1900)</h2>
    <p>His talent started in a young age. He painted his first oil-painting when he was just eight years old. When Picasso was 15 years old, he painted Science and Charity (1897), which can be interpreted both as genre and symbolic painting. Eventhough he excelled in realistic representation in his paintings, he started to move in a diferrent direction. In 1900 he travelled to Paris, where his love for modern art was born. </p>

      <h2>(1901-1904)</h2>
      <p>In 1901 hs dear friend died, and this period was affected by his depression due to his friend`s death. Picasso later recalled: “I started painting in blue when I learned of Casagemas's death”. In this period he gradually escaped the art where he had to create real paintings, but more coming to his own imagination. His first painting in this period is "Potrait de James Sabartes". </p>

      <p>This was a short period, lasting only from 1905-1906. Here he introduced new topics, such as actors and acrobats. He started this epoch with "The Actor". He briefly returned to real forms in his paitings.</p>

      <h1>"African" period</h1>
      <h2>(1906-1908)</h2>
      <p>He entered a creative period, where he wanted to work real life models. This period was the beginning of shape deformation, the Picasso we all know of. The archaic African art inspired him greatly. His characters in paintings started to resemble ritual masks. Pieces from this era give the impression of clumsy bas-reliefs carved out of natural materials. "The Young Ladies of Avignon" was first painting for thsi epoch, and took him a year to finish. His goal was to create a piece of an illusion of three-dimensional space populated by deformed creatures at the two-dimensional plane of the canvas.</p>

      <h1>Cubism</h1>
      <h2>(1908-1921) </h2>
      <p>Before cubism, real looking paintings dominated the art culture. Under the influence of Iberian and African art, Picasso began to roughen and simplify the outlines of figures and objects. Cezanne said: “Treat nature by means of the cylinder, the sphere, the cone. Using these simple basic elements you can do anything”. This concept inspired to Picasso to create "Two nudes". Two bodies are emerged into the nature.</p>

      <h1>Classicism</h1>
      <h2>(1917-1925)</h2>
      <p>Picasso said when asked about his style of art: “When I think about it, I’d say I’m an artist without style”. “Style puts constraints on the artist, forcing a single viewpoint on things upon him, the same techniques, the same formula, year after year, his life long”. His new wife, russian ballet dancer, Olga Khokhlova, set the tone for his paintings in this period. He experimented a lot in this era. The painting "Potrait of Olga in the Armchair" is result of a lot of experiments. </p>

      <h1>Surrealism</h1>
      <h2>(1925-1932)</h2>
      <p>The two factors defined this period: Picasso’s new muse Marie-Thérèse Walter, whose “fascinating face” he desiderated to picture, and the closeness with Andre Breton. It was in the gallery of Pierre in 1925 that Picasso first participated in group exhibition of the Surrealists (previously, his works were presented only at the personal exhibitions only). "The Dream" is a 1932 oil painting which was painted one afternoon of 24-year old Marie-Thérèse Walter.</p>

      <h2>(1937-1945)</h2>
      <p>In 1936, a Civil war between the freshly formed republican government and the fascist regime of General Franco broke out in Spain. Picasso did all he could to support the anti-fascists: his canvas was his battlefield, and his weapons were the brush and paints. "The weeping woman", on focusing on the image of a woman crying, Picasso was no longer painting the effects of just the Spanish Civil War, but rather referring to a universal image of suffering.</p>

      <p>In 1946 Picasso had created the picturesque ensemble from 27 panels and pictures for the noble family Grimaldy in Antibes. It is a small town on the Mediterranean seaside of France. The panel in the first hall was named "The joy of life" and all series is represented as harmony of nature with existence. </p>

      <h1>Later works</h1>
      <h2>(1954-)</h2>
      <p>In 1955, Picasso had settled in the south of France, and returned to Paris only once before he died. Living and working in a series of villas and chateaus, he was creating a diverse range of work, including wooden sculptures and a mural for the UNESCO building in Paris.
Picasso's final works were a mixture of all his styles, his means of expression in constant flux until his death. Picasso became more daring by devoting his full energies to his work. His creations became more colorful and expressive. From 1968 through 1971 he produced a lot of paintings and hundreds of copperplate etchings. At the time these works were appreciated. They were viewed as creation of an old mans pornographic fantasy. Only after Picasso's death, when the rest of the art world had moved on from abstract expressionism, did the community come to realize that Picasso had already discovered neo-expressionism and was, as so he was before, ahead of his time. His self-portrait was painted a little less than a year before his death. A friend, Pierre Daix said: He did not blink. I had the sudden impression that he was staring his own death in the face, like a good Spaniard".</p>
